# Electronics-Health-Record-with-Chatbot-System-using-Blockchain

For my final-year project, I developed an advanced Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) and Chatbot System to enhance healthcare management and diagnostics. This system utilizes blockchain technology to ensure the security and immutability of patient and doctor records, addressing critical concerns around data integrity and privacy.

# About The Project
I developed an innovative Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) and Chatbot System as a final-year project, leveraging blockchain technology for secure and immutable patient and doctor records. The system features a chatbot to predict and diagnose patient symptoms. The front end uses HTML, CSS, and REACT JS, while Firebase databases manage data storage and retrieval. This project demonstrates proficiency in web development and blockchain applications for healthcare solutions.
